      <LegalSection title="1. Introduction">
        <p>
          Prompter ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our website and services (collectively, the "Service"). By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="2. Information We Collect">
        <p>We collect several types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our Service to you.</p>
        <div>
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-2">Information You Provide to Us</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you register for an account, we collect your name, email address, and a hashed version of your password. You may also voluntarily provide additional profile information, such as a biography and an avatar image.</li>
                <li><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> We collect all content you create and submit to the Service, including prompts, prompt collections, descriptions, tags, comments, and feedback messages.</li>
                <li><strong>Payment Information:</strong> When you subscribe to our Pro plan or purchase a collection from the marketplace, our third-party payment processor (e.g., Stripe) will collect your payment information. We do not directly store sensitive payment details such as your full credit card number. We only receive a token or confirmation of payment.</li>
                <li><strong>Communications:</strong> If you contact us directly, such as through our feedback page, we will collect your name, email address, and the contents of your message.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-2">Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
             <ul>
                <li><strong>Browser Storage:</strong> We use your browser's local storage to enhance your experience. For example, if you are not logged in, we save your theme preference (light/dark mode) in local storage so the site remembers your choice on your next visit. Our authentication provider (Firebase) may also use browser storage mechanisms like IndexedDB to securely manage your login session. This is essential for keeping you logged in. You can clear your browser's storage, but this may log you out or reset your preferences.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="3. How We Use Your Information">
        <p>We use the information we collect for various purposes, including to:</p>

            <li>Manage your account, including processing your subscriptions, purchases, and payments.</li>
            <li>Display your public profile and User-Generated Content to other users as part of our community and marketplace features.</li>

            <li>Communicate with you, including sending important account-related emails (like email verification and password resets) and responding to your feedback or inquiries.</li>
            <li>Analyze usage to understand how our Service is used so we can improve it.</li>
            <li>Prevent fraud, enforce our Terms and Conditions, and comply with legal obligations.</li>

                  <li><strong>Google Gemini API:</strong> When you use our prompt generator, we send the necessary inputs (your description, chosen tone, and category) to the Gemini API to generate the prompt.</li>

        <p>

        <p>If you have any requests regarding your data that you cannot perform through your profile, please contact us.</p>
      </LegalSection>
